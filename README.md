## TiddlyWiki Cloud

TiddlyWiki Cloud (aka TiddlyWiki in the Sky by Jeremy) is a collection of pages which allow the user to read and write TiddlyWiki files and folders in their cloud drive. Currently only Dropbox is supported, but I plan to add more in the future once the code is stable.

Currently there are three different pages that can be used with Dropbox. 

- https://twcloud.github.io/tw5-dropbox/ - This is the oldest and most dependable loader for TW5 files, but doesn't support TiddlyWiki Classic files. 
- https://twcloud.github.io/dropbox/ - This is a newer loader which uses a different method to load files, but only seems to work on Chrome. Hardly anyone uses it, but you're welcome to try it. It might work with TiddlyWiki Classic.
- https://twcloud.github.io/dropbox-datafolder/ - Still being built, this loader supports loading TiddlyWiki data folders instead of files. It is a complete rewrite and is split into several modules, which makes it a lot easier to use for other cloud services. In the future it will also support data folders.
